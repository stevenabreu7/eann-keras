# Evolving Artificial Neural Networks in Keras

This repository provides a Python Keras implementation of evolving artificial neural networks (term coined by Yao, 1999). Specifically, the code provided shows the implementation of an evolutionary search algorithm applied to the architecture design for deep feedforward neural networks.
